# Spotify-Playlist-Analyzer

Welcome to the Spotify Playlist analyzer! This analyzer takes the info from a <b>public</b> spotify playlist and prints out its 
cover image as well as the info of the song itselfâ€”its name, its artist, the album it belongs to, as well as its metrics. 
You also have the choice of receiving a song recommendation at the end if you so please.
